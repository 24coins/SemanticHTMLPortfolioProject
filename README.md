# Semantic HTML Portfolio

Welcome to the Semantic HTML Portfolio Project! For this project, we'll be converting a portfolio created using basic HTML tags (`div`, `span`, etc) to use HTML 5's more semantic tags.

Please follow the instructions below to complete the project. Be sure to run tests to make sure your tests are passing before submitting your code.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, head over to the [Semantic HTML Portfolio](#) project on Code School, and begin!

To get setup locally, run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Tasks

Complete the following tasks to complete this project.

### Convert the Header to semantic HTML.

The element with a class of "header" isn't using the most semantic HTML tag it could be using. Switch it to use an element that most accurately wraps the header content for a page.
